    <h1>Kenneth Losier</h1>
    <h2>About Kenny</h2>
    	<p>Kenneth Losier was born in Carmichael, California. He lived in Rocklin,
				Roseville, Lincoln, Sacramento, and Folsom before finally moving to
				Santa Cruz. He is currently a freshman at the University of California,
				Santa Cruz with a proposed major in Computer Engineering. Kenny is the
				youngest of his immediate family and has one sister, two brothers, and
				one stepbrother. Ever since the ripe young age of 5, he fell in love with
				sports, and played as many as he could handle up until it was time to
				narrow it down to the favorites. He is a huge animal lover, and has two
				litte dogs back home in Folsom that always wait for him to come home.
				Kenny is a caring, passionate, dedicated, hardworking individual that
				strives to land an important engineering or project manager position at
				a tech startup or large tech company after college. In the future, he
				hopes to be a loving husband and father to a wonderful and beautiful
				family.</p>
