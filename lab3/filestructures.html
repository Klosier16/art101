    <h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The main idea of this lab was to further the students' understanding
      of local file structures in HTML on our computer, how to create them,
      modify them, access them, add index.html files and upload them to github
      to display them on our browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Encountering Difficulties</h2>
    <p>I believe the biggest difficulty I encountered was just starting off the
      assignment. Sometimes, my brain overprocesses information all at once,
      and I have to really focus to start one step at a time to not get
      overwhelmed. After that, the sailing was somewhat smoothe. I did have a
      major issue trying to format the images to my liking. It took me a while
      to figure out how to neatly center or float the images to the left and
      right. Coming from Python, some structuring of the code was foreign to me,
      but after examining Professor Modes' website, Google, and W3Schools, I
      gained a better understanding of how HTML/CSS formatting and structuring
      worked. Padding, margins, and text-align also caused some troubles for me
      at first, but with the help of Google and my partner, I was able to get
      through that obstacle as well.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>You are currently on the html file I created. I also
      was able to design a new website and directory to my future labs!
      Anyways, here is my file structure that I made.</p>
