    <h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
    <p>The main idea of this lab was to further the students' understanding
      of local file structures in HTML on our computer, how to create them,
      modify them, access them, add index.html files and upload them to github
      to display them on our browser.
    </p>
    <h2>Encountering Difficulties</h2>
    <p>I believe the biggest difficulty I encountered was just starting off the
      assignment. Sometimes, my brain overprocesses information all at once,
      and I have to really focus to start one step at a time to not get
      overwhelmed. After that, the sailing was somewhat smoothe. Coming from
      Python, some structuring of the code was foreign to me, but after
      examining Professor Modes' website, Google, and W3Schools, I gained
      a better understanding of how html formatting and structuring worked.
      Padding, margins, and text-align caused some troubles for me at first,
      but with the help of Google and my partner, I was able to get through
      that obstacle.
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>You are currently on the filestructures.html file I created. I also
      was able to design a new website and directory to my future labs!
      Anyways, here is my file structure that I made.
